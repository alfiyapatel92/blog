                            <p>Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. It
                                occurs when the ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, leading to the cessation of

                            <p>Menopause is typically diagnosed when a woman has gone without a period for 12 consecutive
                                months. It is a normal part of aging and usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although
                                it can happen earlier or later.</p>
                            <p>During menopause, women may experience a range of symptoms, including hot flashes, mood changes,
                                sleep disturbances, vaginal dryness, and more. However, not all women experience symptoms, and
                                there are various treatments available to manage them.</p>
                            <p>If you're experiencing menopause symptoms, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider.
                                They can help you determine the best course of treatment based on your individual needs.</p>
