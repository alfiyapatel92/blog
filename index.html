              <p>Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when it comes to their body reacting
                to
                certain conditions - emotionally, mentally or physically.</p>
              <p>These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases of our life, the kind that we see
                in movies but
                have not explicitly discussed before it happens.</p>
              <p>We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood swings with frequent tears or
                outbursts.</p>
              <p>The worst part?</p>
              <p>The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they think we’re going crazy.
                Honestly, we are not going crazy... It's just menopause!</p>
              <p>Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive abilities.
              </p>
              <p>And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the
                never-ending
                list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.</p>
              <p>But...</p>
              <p>Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the process of solving them (as
                promised,
                as easy as 1, 2, 3)!</p>
              <br />

                <li> 1 Perimenopause or Premenopause</li>

          <h2>1. Perimenopause</h2>
          <p>Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin several years before menopause. This could last between a few
            months to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts about 4 years.</p>

              <h2>What happens ?</h2>
              <h3>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</h3>
              <p>This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around the age of 40. In some cases, it
                could start as
                early as when women are in their 30s.</p>
              <p>This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family should
                try and utilize
                every open opportunity with their partner!</p>
              <h3>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</h3>
              <p>The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our menstrual cycle- there could be longer gaps
                between
                periods or spotting between 2 cycles.</p>
              <p>Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period next is not enough; the flow would
                differ too,
                making it heavier or lighter over time.</p>
              <h3>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h3>
              <p>Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased insomnia or hot
                flashes..</p>
              <p>This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy levels; getting tired even after sitting
                at work the entire
                day or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would be common.</p>

            <h2>What happens ?</h2>
            <h3>Ovaries stop releasing eggs.</h3>
            <p>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.
              At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder. Hence, we notice the use of hormonal
              therapy or IVF
              for childbirth.
              We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and watch Netflix instead of going out and
              getting
              drinks with our girlfriends.</p>


            <h3>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</h3>
            <p>Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our blanket away or turning your fan on max
              even
              though the aircon is on full blast.
              Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart rate; followed by
              suddenly feeling cold. </p>
            <h3> Significant physical changes.</h3>
            <p>The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes to reality. Eating one slice of cake
              for dinner
              could increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction in our metabolic rate."
              It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and thinner; no amount of conditioner and
              lotion
              seem to absolutely solve this problem. </p>

            symptoms
            decrease but it comes with additional side effects.</p>

            <h2>What happens ?</h2>
            <h3>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</h3>
            <p>This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically lower the level of estrogen in our
              body.
              By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after work is a norm.
            </p>

            <h3>Higher risk of certain health conditions.</h3>
            <p>Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause are diabetes, joint pains,
              osteoporosis,
              cholesterol and heart disease.
              This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is like drawing a lottery ticket- we need
              to
              maintain a healthy lifestyle to combat such possibilities.</p>

            <h3>Difficulty concentrating and memory lapses (often temporary)</h3>
            <p>Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over time. However, these are temporary symptoms of
              postmenopause. We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors which could also cause depression
              and anxiety.</p>

            <p>Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it affects our daily life! Symptoms like
              reduction in metabolic rates and estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size of our
              abdomen; night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30 years older...are just to name a few.
              Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in 3 easy steps; which can make this
              journey a little less frustrating!
              We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and solving it can be as easy as 1, 2, 3!
